\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{images/author1.jpg}}]{Author One} All authors may include 
biographies. Biographies are often not included in conference-related
papers. The first paragraph may contain a place and/or date of birth (list place, then date). Next,
the author's educational background is listed. The degrees should be
listed with type of degree in what field, which institution, city,
state, and country, and year the degree was earned. The author's major
field of study should be lower-cased. 

The second paragraph uses the pronoun of the person (he or she) and not the 
author's last name. It lists military and work experience, including summer 
and fellowship jobs. Job titles are capitalized. The current job must have a 
location; previous positions may be listed 
without one. Information concerning previous publications may be included. 
Try not to list more than three books or published articles. The format for 
listing publishers of a book within the biography is: title of book 
(publisher name, year) similar to a reference. Current and previous research 
interests end the paragraph. The third paragraph begins with the author's 
title and last name (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\ Hunter). 
List any memberships in professional societies other than the IEEE. Finally, 
list any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications. If a 
photograph is provided, it should be of good quality, and 
professional-looking. Following are two examples of an author's biography.
